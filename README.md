# Loan-Prediction-System
Banks are making a major part of profits through loans. Though a lot of people are applying for loans. Itâ€™s hard to select a genuine applicant, who will repay the loan. While doing the process manually, a lot of misconceptions may happen to select the genuine applicant. Therefore I develop a loan prediction system using machine learning, so the system automatically selects the eligible candidates. This is helpful to both bank staff and applicants. The time period for the sanction of the loan will be drastically reduced. In this project, I predict the loan data by using some machine learning algorithms which are the Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Logistic Regression Model.
